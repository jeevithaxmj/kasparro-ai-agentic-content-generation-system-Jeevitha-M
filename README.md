# Agentic Content Generation System

This repository implements a modular, agent-based content generation system that transforms structured product data into machine-readable content pages.

The system is designed to demonstrate agentic workflows, reusable logic blocks, and centralized orchestration — aligning with real-world Applied AI engineering practices.

---

## System Overview

The system converts raw product metadata into three structured content outputs:

- FAQ Page
- Product Description Page
- Product Comparison Page (against a fictional competitor)

Each page is generated by an independent agent coordinated through a central orchestrator.

---

## Architecture Highlights

- **Agents**  
  Independent, single-responsibility components that generate specific content pages.

- **Logic Blocks**  
  Reusable validation and formatting utilities shared across agents.

- **Orchestrator**  
  Central controller that coordinates agent execution and manages data flow.

- **Structured Outputs**  
  Deterministic, JSON-based outputs suitable for downstream systems.

---

## Output

Generated outputs are available in the `output/` directory:
- `faq.json`
- `product_page.json`
- `comparison_page.json`

---

## Design Philosophy

The system emphasizes:
- Separation of concerns  
- Deterministic generation over free-form text  
- Modularity and extensibility  
- Production-aligned agent orchestration patterns
