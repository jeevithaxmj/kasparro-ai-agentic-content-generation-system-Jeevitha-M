# Problem Statement

Design and implement a modular multi-agent system that ingests structured product data and autonomously generates machine-readable content pages using reusable logic blocks, templates, and orchestrated agents.

# Solution Overview

This solution implements an agentic content generation pipeline composed of independent agents, reusable content logic blocks, and a custom template engine. The system converts raw product data into structured internal models, generates categorized user questions, applies transformation logic, and assembles multiple content pages as clean JSON outputs.

# Scopes & Assumptions

- The system operates only on the provided product dataset.
- No external data sources or domain knowledge are used.
- Product B in the comparison page is fictional and internally defined.
- The system is deterministic and designed for extensibility.
- The focus is on system design and automation, not content creativity.

# System Design

(Will be expanded to describe agent responsibilities, orchestration flow, and template-driven page assembly.)
